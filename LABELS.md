# LABELS

## What?

The back-story is that one day I said:

```
It's not so much a "mailing address" as it different types of labels / names for a place

short name (Montreal) versus long name (Montreal, Quebec, Canada) versus in-between-name
(Montreal, QC, Canada)

versus names that no one uses (Montreal, Montreal (county), Quebec, Canada) versus the part
where the English have two towns with the same name in the same region so you have to
disambiguate on county

versus names with neighbourhoods which would be a hilarious trend to start with the postal
service

as of this writing there are only short names but there should be others, yes

also versus things with postal codes that sometimes make no sense, like a display label for
a geotagged photo

so, I think what would be useful / helpful is to start identifying the kinds of labels we
need to pre-calculate

and from there we can start to write an opencagedata style spec for actually generating them
based on country / locale / etc.
```

So this is that document.
